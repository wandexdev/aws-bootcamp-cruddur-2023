# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing
![cover](assets/wk2/wk2.png)

## Synopsis:
Week 2 emphasized **observability** and I learnt about its 4 pillars (metrics, logs, events and traces) as well as how crucial it is in the entire software development cycle. 

## [Required Homework](#required)
### 1. Instrument backend flask app to Open Telemetry (OTEL) using Honeycomb.io
- opened honeycomb.io
- created an honey comb account then created a new envirnment called bootcamp
- clicked API keys to get the API_HONEYCOMB_KEY
- exported as an environment variable and to saved it to gitpod's envirnment when restarted.

- The Service name determines the spans that get sent from the application.
- It is preferable not to set them in the work envirnment to prevent consistency. we want them set seperately so theyre specific to the services. e.g like hardcoding it in docker compose.
- so copied the OTEL_SERVICE_NAME and hard coded it into the backend section of the docker compose
- Confirguring OTEL(Open TElemetry) to send to honeycomb
Open telemetry is part of CNCF() and its a standardized method for all observeabilty tool
```
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT: "https://api.honeycomb.io"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS: "x-honeycomb-team=${HONEYCOMB_API_KEY}"
```
- cd backend folder
- put in the installation command from honeycomb docs to instrument a Flask app with OpenTelemetry in the requirements.txt file:
- requests are the python http client so when we make outgoing http calls, it instruments it
```
opentelemetry-api
opentelemetry-sdk
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http
opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask
opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests
```
- run:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
![honeycomb](assets/wk2/pipinstalltxt.png)
- Next step is adding the initializion lines to the flaskapp.py file and make comments to distinguish. These updates will create and initialize a tracer and Flask instrumentation to send data to Honeycomb:
```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.requests import RequestsInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
```
- Next
```python
# HoneyComb -----------
# Initialize tracing and an exporter that can send data to Honeycomb
provider = TracerProvider()
processor = BatchSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter())
provider.add_span_processor(processor)
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)
```
- Next
```python
# Initialize automatic instrumentation with Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
FlaskInstrumentor().instrument_app(app)
RequestsInstrumentor().instrument()
```
### 2. Run Queries to explore traces within Honeycomb.io
- Testing the setup
    - Already had my frontend initialised thanks to the gitpod configuration
    - cd to root folder
    - Docker Compose up
    - All set and receiving data

- To debug or test if you're unsure where the api key is coming from, try [honeycomb-whoami.glitch.me](honeycomb-whoami.glitch.me)
-Hardcode spans: The code is to create spans for the backend flask
- go to honey comb docs for open telemetry and python
```python
from opentelemetry import trace

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)
with tracer.start_as_current_span("http-handler"):
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("my-cool-function"):
        # do something
```
- Adding attributes to the span we created
```python
span = trace.get_current_span()
span.set_attribute("user.id", user.id())
```

### 3. Instrument AWS X-Ray into backend flask app
- X-ray is an AWS Observabilty service
- an **x-ray deamon** collects and batches to the **x-ray api** inorder to visualize your data 
- copy ```aws-xray-sdk``` and paste in ```requirements.txt``` in the backend folder
- run pip install -r requirements.txt
- Add the below xray configuration codes to the ```app.py``` file
```python
from aws_xray_sdk.core import xray_recorder
from aws_xray_sdk.ext.flask.middleware import XRayMiddleware

xray_url = os.getenv("AWS_XRAY_URL")
xray_recorder.configure(service='backend-flask', dynamic_naming=xray_url)

XRayMiddleware(app, xray_recorder)
```

- touch ```aws/json/xray.json``` to create a new file in the aws directory and paste:
```json
{
  "SamplingRule": {
      "RuleName": "Cruddur",
      "ResourceARN": "*",
      "Priority": 900
  }
}
```
- Create Log group:
```shell
aws xray create-group \
   --group-name "Cruddur" \
   --filter-expression "service(\"backend-flask\")"
```
![xray](assets/wk2/xraycreategroup.png)
![xray](assets/wk2/consoleloggroup.png)
- Create sampling rule
- cd root folder and paste: ```aws xray create-sampling-rule --cli-input-json file://aws/json/xray.json```
[json sampling rule](assets/wk2/jsonsamplingrule.png)
[console sampling rule](/assets/wk2/consolesamplingrule.png)
### 4. Configure, provision X-Ray daemon within docker-compose 
### 5. Observe X-Ray in AWS console
### 6. Integrate Rollbar and capture error
### 7. Configure custom logger to send CloudWatch Logs
